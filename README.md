# IoT Music Visualization

Project for Visualization of Different Music Pitches in a particular range to lights in a linear HSV pallete .

## How it works
1. Records Audio Samples in an Andorid Phone at sampling frequency 22050 Hz
2. Detects most probalble pitch of the sound sample 
3. Maps the frequency into HSV values and sends to ESP32 Device
4. Device converts the HSV values to RGBW values and relays to LED bulb using PWM

IoT music visualization using ESP32 for mapping HSV values from Android App to RGBW lights .
